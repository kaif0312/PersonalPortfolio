Hello. I can help with your PersonalPortfolio project.

I see two PDFs in the workspace:
- `AScI_summer_research_project_list_2026.pdf`
- `Research_CV_Draft.pdf`

What would you like to work on? I can help with:
- Setting up a portfolio website
- Processing or organizing these documents
- Building features for your portfolio
- Anything else you need

What should we start with?
